------------------------------
This hmod requires the options menu hmod by CompCom.

It adds a new entry to the option menu called Time Options which
allows you to set the date and time in an easy to follow step by step method and also
increment and decrement the system clock's time and date manually.

Setting the clock backwards manually will not show the time and will reset the cursors
position to the top but it does change the time back. This method was chosen
because trying to do it the same way as setting the clock forward caused the
system to hang.
