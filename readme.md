------------------------------
This hmod requires the options menu hmod by CompCom.

It adds a new entry to the option menu called Time Options which
allows you to increment and decrement the system clock's time and date.

Setting the clock backwards will not show the time and reset the cursors
position but it does change the time back. This method was chosen because
trying to do it the same way as setting the clock forward caused the
system to hang.
